When you were in college,

you wanted a job.

 

When you got a job in service-based company,

You wanted product-based.

 

When you got 5 LPA package,

you wanted 20 LPA.

 

When you got 25 LPA,

You wanted 40 LPA.

 

When you got 50 LPA CTC,

you wanted 50 LPA Fixed.

 

When you got 60 LPA fixed,

You wanted to build a startup.

 

When you got successful in that,

you wanted early retirement.

 

When you retired early,

you wanted unlimited passive income.

 

When you got everything you ever wanted,

You wanted time to enjoy it.

 

Hence,

Time is your most valuable asset and it cannot be equated with your earnings. Enjoy your 20s and 30s by both working hard and playing hard. Feel the satisfaction of hitting milestones. The finish line is not really important.

 

Achieve your own goals ( Not society's expectations )

You don't need to prove anything to anyone but yourself.

 

Nobody is measuring you, they are busy in their lives.

You are the only opponent to yourself in this battle.

 

The sooner you realize this,

Your priorities start to change.

 

Life becomes meaningful.
